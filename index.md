## About

My research spans two directions: the mathematical analysis of stochastic processes underlying generative models such as diffusion models, and the study of dynamical systems through nonlinear and optimal control theory.  
I am also interested in integrating these perspectives by developing control-theoretic methods for steering the distributional evolution of generative models.
